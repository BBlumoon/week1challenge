# Module 1 Challenge

## Description

- This project was built to help me better understand some fundamental HTML elements as well as other things that help the person reading the code.
- This project solves some issues with the links on the website so that they function properly. Additionally, alt attributes and comments on the CSS were added.
- Through this project I learned about how and why alt attributes should be added to HTML image sources. It also helped me understand some of the required structure for HTML elements.

## Installation

To deploy this project I first had to create a new repository and clone it in the terminal. Then I made sure that all changes were committed over and then I could deploy the webpage from github
